# shinyscreenshot

Not yet released. WIP for 2 years, will be released soon (functionality is finished, just need to finish the documentation.)

Does not work in IE

Inspired by https://community.rstudio.com/t/taking-screenshots-within-a-shiny-app/6892 (this is the second package that I make for the general public just because Eric asked a question that interested me and included a good resource)

timevis renders nicely with shinyscreenshot but not with the other 2 new packages, html2canvas doesnt render well parts of pages
